# AstraG_DRL_ParkSens
Dynamic turn signals and daytime running lights with custom animations - ESP32

Parking sensor and accelerometer outputting info to an OLED display - Arduino Nano

Warning: I'm an amateur, not a senior developer - code may be (and most likely is) trash.

TO DO:
- make it universal - only animation speed change needed (hopefully)
- add comments
- code cleanup
